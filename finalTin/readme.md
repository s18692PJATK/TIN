Good Reads v2 is a very simple single-page application, that only supports
basic CRUD operations. I wrote backend in js with express and frontend in
[Elm](https://elm-lang.org/)  
(it is already compiled to javascript so you don't need to install it yourself)  
In order to run backend you should call "npm install" in tin_backend directory  
and then run node app.js  
In order to run frontend, run "http-server-spa ."(note the dot at the end)  
in the tin_frontend directory.  
If http-server-spa is not installed on your system  
you can install it with "npm-install http-server-spa".
